# riFly

Automated check-in for Southwest Airlines flights -- a work in progress.

## Getting Started

I'm unsure how exactly I want people to be able to interact with this.  Current options include:

* Chrome/Firefox extension
* House it on my website (rileyleff.com)
* Enable installation and setup on local machines

I'll figure this out eventually.

## Built With

* [Flask](URL.com) - Web stuff
* [Django](URL2.com) - Web stuff
* [Google Cloud](URL3.com) - Hosting
