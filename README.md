# RiFly

Automated check-in for Southwest Airlines flights -- a work in progress.  

## Getting Started

I'm unsure how exactly I want people to be able to interact with this.  Current options include:

* Chrome/Firefox extension
* House it on my website (rileyleff.com)
* Enable installation and setup on local machines

I'll figure this out eventually.  

### Prerequisites

Don't know how I'm handling this either.  Perhaps you'll need to do something code-y, like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/RileyLeff/RiFly
```

### Installing

Install step one

```
cd RiFly
```

I'm just writing this README to practice okay sheesh

```
python3 RiFly/go.py
```

Demo here

## Running the tests

Hah I need to learn how to do this

### Break down into end to end tests

Test 1: does it work

```
python3 RiFly/test1.py
```

### And coding style tests

Test 2: does it not suck

```
python3 RiFly/test2.py
```
